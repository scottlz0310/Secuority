## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Report privately

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

- **Email**: Send details to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com)
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" button in the Security tab

### 3. Include detailed information

Please include as much information as possible:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 4. Response timeline

- **Initial Response**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: We will assess the vulnerability and determine its impact within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: We will work on a fix and keep you updated on progress
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Bandit for security linting
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety for vulnerability detection
- **Secret Detection**: Gitleaks for preventing secret leaks
- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merging

### CI/CD Security
- **Automated Security Scans**: Run on every PR and push
- **Dependency Updates**: Automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- **SARIF Integration**: Security findings uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected with required status checks

### Infrastructure Security
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions for CI/CD
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of API keys and tokens
- **Container Security**: Docker images scanned for vulnerabilities
